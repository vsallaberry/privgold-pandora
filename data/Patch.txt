  10. CHANGES FROM 1.2.3 TO 1.2.4

    Vegastrike 0.4.4.5 / PrivateerGold-pandora 1.2.4

    Sorry about this release coming so late, as most of features were ready in
    may 2022, but those times were not easy, and I additionnally had HDD failures.

    A. Logging to file and Log Timestamps

       - File logging by application rather than by scripts and file redirections.

       - Timestamps are included in logs (we use the Main Loop counter rather 
         than time measurement: less accurate but faster).

    B. Windows: don't open console when running + Icons

       - The Console (cmd) is used only if the game is run from it.
         The Console (cmd) window is no more shown when running the game,
         but command line features are still available when run from console.

       - vegastrike, vssetup, vslauncher, privgold, privsetup include now 
         windows version info and icons.

    C. Unicode combined characters

       - On old macOS with HFS filesystem, the system encodes the filename in 
         utf8 in the decomposed utf8 form. For example, the accentuated e,
         would be in composed form: \xc3\xa9, and \c65\xcc\x81 if decomposed.
         This did not forbid privateer versions up to 1.2.3 to run, all
         was working fine (save, load, overwrite detection, save a game with
         the utf8 composed form). The only limitation was when displaying
         a file given by the macOS HFS API outside of console: the file
         was displayed without accent, without forbidding the game to
         perform norminally.
         
       - The Linux, Windows, and apple APFS filesystems (since Sierra)
         do not use the decomposed form as in HFS.

    D. Splashscreen: wait for loading end, optional text animation

       - The Privateer Menu is displayed only when it is ready (game fully loaded)
         Before this update, we had to wait a few seconds between apparition of menu
         and the motion of the mouse.

       - During Game Loading, a little text animation is shown at bottom-left corner
         of the screen.

    E. OpenGL engines: GLUT nvidia-linux, Window Managers timeouts, Alt+Tab, Unicode Text Editing

       - SDL gnome: workaround on linux when some window managers (such as gnome) 
         complain about non-responsivity of application (but still working and 
         resumable with alt-tab or similar)

       - GLUT on linux: with some GL drivers (such as proprietary nvidia), GLUT
         could not enter in Game Mode (Fullscreen - OK with nouveau). Now the game
         tries to create a window even if the Game Mode cannot be initialized.

       - SDL2 Text Editing: better handling of unicode combined characters.

       - macOS alt+tab: in some cases, resuming vegastrike on macOS after an alt-tab
         restored the window in a shifted position. Moreover, now only Command (cmd)/Tab
         switches applications.

       - add the OpenGL anti-aliasing option (improves rendering of non-texture geometric forms)
         Disabled by default. A recent processor and an highend graphic card is needed for that.

       - Use SDL2 TEXTINPUT event only if available.

    F. PRIVATEER CAMPAIGNS IMPROVEMENTS

       - Fix: Accept/Reject Choices do not show up when exiting the conversation (Return_To_Bar).
         If you have saved a game with previous version, you must click the fixer and end
         conversation in order to fix the savegame.

       - Fix: Lynch Record-CleanUp Offer: Lynch do not show up in Basque before miggs is killed.

       - New: Fix and Enable the Bonus Campaign once Righteous Fire campaign is finished.

    G. vslauncher: Old vegastrike launcher utility

       - enable build of old vegastrike launcher
     
       - Cross platform way of launching the game without need of specific scripts.

    H. OpenAL on macOS (3D Sound Library)

       - Rather than using the system OpenAL Framework, Now OpenAL is included in release.

       - It seems that using a rebuilt and recent openal library rather than
         system one on macOS has improved sound quality and might reduce the 
         issue of ship cannon sounds not stopping when leaving/finishing the battle.

    I. Vegastrike Config updates 

       - add graphical resolutions: 1366x768 and 1280x720

       - restore Privateer Gemini Gold v1.03 default sound settings ("Sound and Music",...)

    J. Python Optional Libraries, Python Optimization.

       - macOS and linux python library is now built with optimization (llvm-profiler).

       - Python bytecode is by default PYO (basic bytecode optimization)

       - Some native libraries (lib-dynload) required by some python modules are included in this release.

       - Some python standard module have been updated to 2.7 version.

    K. GTK libraries on linux and macOS arm64

       - GTK libraries and then graphical vssetup and vslauncher are now included on
         linux x86_64 and macOS arm64 releases.

    L. EXPERIMENTAL linux-i386 and Windows-i386 (32 bits)

       - The linux 32 version has not been tested.

       - The Windows 32 bits version has been tested on Windows XP SP3 32 bits, 
         Windows 10 64 bits(Virtual Machine) and Windows 7 on 32 bit machine.

    M. Windows: running the game from a path containing unicode characters

    N. The optimization level of vegastrike programs has been increased (Os -> O3)

    O. Linux RUNPATH : vegastrike is built with Linux RUNPATH 
       (move your installation folder without need of tunning LD_LIBRARY_PATH)

    P. libpng 1.6, macOS and windows GTK themes

    Q. Console (Command Interpreter)

       - Enable it (Ctrl+shift+C).

       - Show python command output in grapical console

       - Handle some 'readline' shortcuts (up+down for history,
         left/right alt+left/right to navigate in edited text, PageDown/Up to scroll in
         console output,Home/End to go at beginning/end of edited text, ...)

    R. Base/config file : BINDINGS

       -  Handle Bindings (<bind key="..." ... scope="base") while in base the 
          same way it is done during game (in copckpit).
          Links navigation is done via bindings.

       - Add bindings exiting the game from Base as it is done in cockpit (ESC/Atl+x)

       - Fix the mouse wheel and digital hatswitch processing
    
       - possibility to generate digital-hatswtch events when axes are moving

    S. linux64 wayland

        - build (and deliver) SDL2 with wayland and x11 support

        - build (and deliver) GLUT with wayland and x11 support

    W. Windows x86_64 tests on real windows 10 computer

       - 1.2.3 has been tested on real windows 10 computer in addition to tests done
         with windows 10 & 7 on Virtual Machines.
 
    Z. see git for more details

       - In this Windows release the HOME dir (where user data including

He started as a ship technician, but by virtue of his astounding eloquence and technical skill, he quickly attained a position of leadership. Within a year, he commanded a church battalion. Within three years, he was an Elite Guard Commander. He was soon in a position equal to my own. When his holiness Father Benengeli, the previous church leader, died a year ago, it was revealed that he had appointed Mordecai Jones as his successor. Jones? leadership brought the church a stunning string of victories. He provided us with new Kilrathi ships and stronger arms. And, of course, our new secret weapon. I believe it is known to you: Yes. The Steltek super-weapon. Church engineers have already learned how to duplicate it. The copies have been used experimentally. Mass production is imminent.

Six months ago, I accidentally came upon some transmissions from Jones to Governor Menesch. They mentioned ?The Ulterior Motive?. A plan I had never heard of. My suspicions were aroused. Further research revealed the nature of this plan. In summary, it led to Jones? domination of Gemini, and gave Menesch a great deal of power and wealth. When the entire region was secure, Jones would dismantle the Church of Man. He planned to use churchmen as a police force. No ultimate destruction of technology. Only megalomania. It's an old story. Somehow, though, I'm surprised that it's worked again."),

				 ("Burrows","Pretty crazy. Your word is all I have."),
				 ("Informant","That is true. Of course, during the mission you will discover our headquarters. If you wish, you can inform the Confederation and they can eventually destroy it. We will be forced to relocate. Very costly and disruptive. But it's worth it to me."),
				 ("Burrows","Why me? Why not take this to the Confederation?"),

SOS! This is an ejected $MT pilot under attack by a $AN craft. I request immediate assistance to the $DS system and will offer $PY credits for a safe return to the local planet where I may recover.
HELP! $CL wants you to rescue one of our ejected pilots in the $DS system. Further information indicate that an attack is very possible. Only the pilot can tell us what happened to our ship. $CL offers you $PY credits.
EMERGENCY CALL! This is a $MT pilot under attack. Need assistance in the $DS system. Engines are down and hull breach imminent. Have to eject. Please help me. I will transfer $PY credits to your account when i am safe. Hurry...
Perry Naval Base is missing a highly decorated military pilot who recently visited the $DS system. We bet he is still alive somewhere. Trouble with locals possible. Get $PY credits if you return the pilot alive.
We knew the route through the $DS was risky, now we have lost contact to our ship. $CL will transfer you $PY credits for any information you can find about our ship. Maybe someone survived the trip who you just need to pick up?

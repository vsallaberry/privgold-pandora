/*

The whole concept of a BSP Tree is that any plane (since it has an
infinite surface) divides the space in two parts: "in front" of the
plane and "behind" the plane (in fact BSP stands for Binary Space
Partition). So a BSP Tree's node, which has the values A,B,C and D of
the plane equation (Ax+By+Cz+d=0), a flag ("in front","behind" or
"undetermined" and two pointers (for the two sub-trees), the left
pointer and the right pointer. 

To build a BSP tree, you start with an empty tree (NULL). Then calculate
a plane (from a poly) and put it in the tree. After this you must add
the other polys: if they are behind the plane or on the plane, take the
left pointer. If they are in front of the plane, take the right pointer.
If the node has a plane equation, put the flag the value of
"undetermined", otherwise put "behind" or "front" as needed. A very
important note: if a given plane intersects a polygon, you must add that
poly's plane both to the left and right subtree (see the recursive
function called put_plane_in_tree3 to see what i mean..
put_plane_in_tree4 is the same, except it handles quadrilaters(sp?) ).

After the tree is built, the game should test the tree for collisions:
supply the ship's coordinates to the BSP Tree test routine and follow
the appropriate paths (left or right). If you reach a "front" value,
then there is no collision. If you reach the "behind" value, then a
collision just occurred and VS should deal with it appropriately:)

Here's a proposed form for the node:

struct BSP_Node
        {
        char flag;
        float a,b,c,d;
        struct BSP_Node * left;
        struct BSP_Node * right;
        }



I'm sending you a small BMP along with the source code to demonstrate
how should a tree be built and tested. If there's anything you don't
understand, e-mail me back and i'll try to explain things a bit better:)

Seeya!:)

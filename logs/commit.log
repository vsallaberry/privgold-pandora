[vegastrike] add boost 1.50

[vegastrike] build, improve c++11 compatibility

Improve compatibility with more recent compilers/standards,
Now we can build with gcc 6 with -std=gnu++11.
Work in progress.

* CMakeLists/configure.ac: supports internal boost 1.50

* improve c++11 compliance
  That required some source updates, including upgrade of internal boost:
  + some conflicts with some std:: c++11 functions suchs as copysign,fmin,fmax,stoi,...
  + some casts to void *

* build.sh:
  + use gnu++11,boost_1.50 by default
  + add --cxx-flags to change -std= for instance
  + fix sdk detection from compiler (gcc -v parsing)

* CMakeLists.txt / configure.ac / m4scripts / Makefile.am / *config.h*
  + boost 1.50 support
  + use boost 1.50 by default on macos (CMAKELists only)
  + detect include unordered_map (without tr1/)
    this is not used yet as tr1 and std not compatible, but
    source has the HAVE_* mamcros to do the job

* Source is not compatible yet with clang or gcc > 7
